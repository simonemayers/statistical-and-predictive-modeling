# Statistical and Predictive Modeling in R

This project features R scripts that demonstrate the implementation of advanced statistical techniques and predictive modeling, focusing on applications such as medical diagnosis and environmental factor analysis.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- **R**: You need R installed on your machine to run the script.

### Required R Packages:
- **knitr**: For reporting features.
  - Install the necessary package using R:
    ```R
    install.packages("knitr")
    ```

### Execution
- Clone this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/statistical-predictive-modeling.git
  cd statistical-predictive-modeling
  ```
- Run the R script:
  ```bash
  Rscript statistical_predictive_modeling.R
  ```

### File Structure
- `statistical_predictive_modeling.R`: Main script file containing R code for analysis, prediction, and data presentation.

### Contributing
Contributions to enhance or extend the analysis are welcome. Please adhere to this simple workflow:
- Fork the repository.
